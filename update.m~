function [basicvars, cB, B, xB]  =  update(m, c, A, b, s, r, basicvars, cB, B, xB)
%   Updates the basis representation.
%
%   Input:
%       m,n     =   number of constraints and variables
%
c
= nx1 cost vector
%
A
= mxn constraint matrix
%
b
= mx1 rhs matrix
%
s
= index of entering variable
%
r
= position in the basis of the leaving variable
%
basicvars = 1xm vector of indices of basic variables
%
cB
= mx1 basic cost vector
%
B
= mxm basis matrix
%
xB
= mx1 basic variable vector
% Output:
%
basicvars = 1xm updated basicvars vector
%
cB
= mx1 updated basic cost vector
%
B
= mxm updated basis matrix
%
xB
= mx1 updated basic variable vector
