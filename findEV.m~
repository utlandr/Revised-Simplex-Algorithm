function [s, minrc] =   findEV(n, c, A, pi)
%   Returns the index of the entering variable and it's reduced cost,
%   or returns 0 if no entering variable exists
%
%   Input:
%       m,n         =   number of constraints and variables
%       c
= nx1 cost vector
%
A
= mxn constraint matrix
%
pi
= mx1 dual vector
% Output:
%
s
= index of the entering variable
%
minrc = reduced cost of the entering variable
